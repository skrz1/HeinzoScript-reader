# HeinzoScript-reader
This is a software that reads HeinzoScript

HeinzoScript is my own idea how to create a file that contains text and images without
using Word, or any other text editor. All you really need is to be able to create .txt file.


Install python libraries.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
